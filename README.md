# 📊 NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing NHS Accident and Emergency (A&E) data from January 1, 2021 to January 30, 2025. It visualizes critical KPIs such as total attendances, emergency admissions, and wait time performance across provider trusts and department types.

The dashboard is divided into two main sections for targeted analysis:

Accident Dashboard
Focuses on attendance trends, 4-hour wait targets, and provider-specific delays.

Emergency Dashboard
Highlights emergency admissions, departmental performance, and provider-level comparisons.
